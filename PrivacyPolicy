‘Driving Lesson Tracker: Pupils’ does not collect, use, save, or have access to any of the users personal data. Any data inputted by the user is saved on the user’s device only. 

‘Driving Lesson Tracker: Pupils' may also ask for relevant information such as theory test date, practial test date, and date of next lesson. This is only saved on the device and cannot be accessed by ‘Driving Lesson Tracker: Pupils’ outside of the local application itself. The data asked for is only for use by the user to track their lessons. We do not share any data with outside sources and only implement Google AdMobs.

The data that is stored locally on the device will be immediately deleted as soon as the lesson is deleted from the lesson list.
